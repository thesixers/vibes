# 🎧 VIBES — Desktop Music Player  
*A GeNeSix App*

## About Vibes

Vibes is a desktop music player I built because… honestly?  
Most Linux music players look boring. Flat. Lifeless.  
So I decided to build one that actually looks and feels good.

I chose **Electron** so Vibes can run on:

- 🐧 Linux  
- 🍎 macOS  
- 🪟 Windows  

One codebase, all platforms.

## How It Works

1. You download and open Vibes.  
2. The app scans your **default Music folder**.  
3. For each song, it generates a search query.  
4. That query is sent to the **Vibes Spotify server**.  
5. Spotify returns the real song details (title, artist, cover art, etc).  
6. Only songs that successfully match get saved locally using:  
   - **IndexedDB**  
   - Powered by **Dexie.js**

So your local music ends up looking clean, organized, and beautiful.

## Who It’s For

Vibes is for people who still love:

- Downloading music  
- Owning their files  
- Listening locally without streaming drama  

Old-school style, modern UI.
